            <li>One who opens the set, owns the set. He gets first choice of target.This is plain and simple. If you open you get first choice of the target. If you are coming into the set make sure that you have already worked out a code like “have you seen jimmy” to signify if the person wants a wing.</li><br>
            <li>The primary purpose of wing is to help his friend get his target. Again straight forward, you are not there to compete you are there to DHV your friend and occupy the obstacle.</li><br>
            <li>Don't steal a target. See previous law of winging if you don't get this. NOTE: Stealing the target happens a lot because most people don't understand buying temperature. You are not there to take away attraction or attention you are there to occupy the obstacle.</li><br>
            <li>Always agree with your wing. Never take the girls side over him. He is always right. No matter WHAT he says always agree with him. Most guys trying to compete by being Aggressors or Competitors over women, YOU WILL NOT!</li><br>
            <li>Wing doesn't run the game: His partner gets all the attention. The Wing is just there to have support his friend by laughing at his jokes and building RAPPORT with the group, nothing else. This means that the wing's attention should be focused on the obstacle and building a connection with her.</li><br>
            <li>Wing doesn't hit on anyone until he is sure who is the partner's target in the set. Another very important rule to follow is that you MUST know who the target is before you do anything stupid. When it doubt ask which the bad one is. The bad one will be the target.</li><br>
            <li>Do not enter an opened set unless you are sure you are invited. If you enter a set make sure to first DHV your friend and tell how you guys met, buy him a drink or just do something to raise his value in general.</li><br>
            <li>Once you are talking to the obstacle get her back to her friends. You want the backs of the targets to be against each other, to accomplish this slowly shift to your right or left whichever is positioning her to face AWAY from her friend. This will allow your friend to get much more personal without fear of persecution from her friend.</li><br>
            <li>If anyone comes in the set distract them! If an AMOG comes into the set then you are to befriend him and take him out of the equation to the best of your ability, same with girls. Everyone who is not your friend's target is an obstacle and therefore it is the job of the wing to occupy them!</li><br>
